# Forgetful
Forgetful is an application that I built to help me remember all the cool things I learn. I store these PPT, PDF, DOC, and Google files in a Google Storage instance, and then once a day get an email with 5 questions on what I call "Accumulated Useful Knowledge." My goal is to ensure that my "Un-Google-able" learnings aren't lost to the void.
